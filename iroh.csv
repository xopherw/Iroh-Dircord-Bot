Lady trouble?
As your guidance counselor, I can tell you that words of love are difficult to express. They are like the clouds, always changing and shifting.
You arepretty cute, my tiny nephew.
Now, I hope that you can see that each element has its own strengths, and weaknesses. BUT FIRE IS THE BEST!
Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
I'm going to bed now. Yep. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire. Get it right this time.
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics. Drill it again!
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck. Num num... num...
More tea please?
Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?
Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.
Basics, Zuko! Break his root!
No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. 
Even in exile my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.
Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
You really should open a window in here.
You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.
Ah! The great city of Ba-Sing-Se.
I acknowledged my defeat at Ba-Sing-Se! After 600 days away from home, my men were tired and I was tired, and I'm still tired.
That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!
Sailing into Fire Nation waters... of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish.
It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!
I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.
Quite the contrary. I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for, is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!
This place looks promising!
Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. The missing lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!
There is a storm coming. A big one.
Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.
Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much...
You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.
Your apology is accepted.
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!
Excellent! But, you're all improving. I'm certain you will win if we play again.
Don't give up hope yet. 
Ahh! See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being. 
Well, I'm impressed.
Very impressed.
You got it!
At my age there is really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.
Winter, spring, summer and fall. Winter and spring, summer and fall. Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves.
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
They wanted revenge.
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.
If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew, you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
I think of you as my own.
Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!
the Spirits are not to be trifled with!
We all depend on the balance.
You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you!
Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.
Aaahhh... this is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?
Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.
To what do we owe this honor?
Family sticks together, right?
Zuko! Let's go!
You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking! That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous. Delectable tea? Or deadly poison? 
Where do you live, exactly?
The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile.
Not professional, anyway. 
It's a long, long way to Ba-Sing-Se, but the girls in the city they look soo prett-ay!
And they kiss so sweet that you've really got to meet the girls from Ba-Sing-Se!
Such a kind man!
Where did you get these?
To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.
You must never give in to despair. 
Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. 
In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.
Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.
You sound like my nephew. Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you. Not that I love you; I just met you.
Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
I'm glad.
Get up!
My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.
Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.
There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang; positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together. You provide release and guidance, creating lightning.
Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.
Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.
Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.
Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. 
Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. 
Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! 
Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. 
Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.
It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But, it can make you more powerful too.
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.
Come on. You've got to feel the flow.
Excellent! You've got it!
What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous.
Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!
Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.  They are also a very capable singing group.
Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kachi?  I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right? 
It's nice to see old friends.
Hmm... Old friends that don't want to attack me...
Those who do can always find a friend.
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.
You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.
One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries. 
It is a magnificent sight. 
Once, when I was a different man.
That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but...that's so sad. 
What a handsome baby.
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.
Uh, Does this possibly come in a larger size? 
Eeow! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
Would you like a pot of tea? 
Sick of tea? That's like being sick of breathing!
The secret ingredient is love.
Please son, you're confused. You don't know what you're doing! 
With a poor stance you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.
With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.
While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing.
Happy Birthday my son. If only I could have helped you.
Good tea is its own reward.
There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want for your life, and why.
Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?
I'm begging you Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you? And what do you want?
You did the right thing, nephew. Leave it behind.
Here's some clean water to drink.
You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.
You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake...it was in such conflict with your image of yourself, that you are now at war within your own mind and body.
You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful Prince you were always meant to be.
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop. Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you.
I'm very thankful.
No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know.
Yes! Let's make some tea!
'm brewing as fast as I can! 
Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! 
Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror...instead, we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea. 
Destiny is a funny thing.
Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the "Dragon of the West"? It's more of a demonstration really.
Come on. You'll be fine.
The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?
Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.
I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving... 
You will come to a better place.
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good! 
I am begging you, look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.
I think you should take the rest of the day off. 
You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest. 
You should take some time to heal and rest.
You know, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.
I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost your way. 
You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you restored your honour. And only you can restore the honour of the Fire Nation. 
Not alone. You'll need help.
Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. I know it.
