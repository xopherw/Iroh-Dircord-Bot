Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them.
Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?

Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.
Failure is only the opportunity to begin again. Only this time, more wisely.
Good times become good memories, but bad times become good lessons.

Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.

It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful too.
There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang — positive energy and a negative energy. Only a select few Firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in the moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.

Sick of tea? That’s like being sick of breathing!
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.

It’s a lovely night for a walk. Why don’t you join me? It would clear your head. Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn’t stop you from enjoying tea.
You sound like my nephew. Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone’s support.
You’re looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it’s heartbreaking! That, or it’s the white jade bush, which is poisonous. Delectable tea or deadly poison.

Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life’s true delights.
When you are filled with pride, you leave no room to be filled with wisdom.
There is always time for tea.

Whatever you do to that spirit, I’ll unleash on you tenfold! Let it go now!
